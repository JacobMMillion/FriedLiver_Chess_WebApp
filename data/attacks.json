        "The Fried Liver, a variation of the Two Knights Defense is an opening that sacrifices a knight for an attack on Black’s King. Both players move their king pawn (1. e4 e5), followed by the development of the knights (2. Nf3 Nc6). White goes  Bc4, targeting the f7 pawn and Black responds with Nf6.",
        "From this position, White moves their knight from f3 to g5, attacking the f7 pawn. If Black hadn’t played Nf6, that knight on g5 would simply be captured by the queen.",
        "Black can defend with the queen’s pawn to d5, which blocks the bishop diagonal and attacks it.",
